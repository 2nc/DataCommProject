Dificulties:
I had problems with figuring out how to get my ssl connection working correctly.
Once I began having these problems I spent hours experimenting with ssl and 
just trying to get the examples on the website to work and I was just having a 
real bad time. The biggest difficulty I continue to have on these projects is using
windows as my developing machine, especially this one since I felt like much of the
tutorials would have been easier for me to test out on linux, and along those lines
I should have spent more time in labs to work on it sooner rather saving it for last
minute. I started working on this project much too late for how complex
it was for me. I will need to get better at estimating my time and sticking
to schedules.
